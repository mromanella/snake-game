# snake-game
Game of snake using canvas api.

I wanted to create a game that everyone knows so I went with snake. I did not want to use any heavy game frameworks or engines, so I decided to attempt to create my own which I called "Animator". As I was developing this game I continued to learn new skills, like how to add audio and how to save settings and high scores using IndexedDB. This was a really fun project that taught me a few new APIs
